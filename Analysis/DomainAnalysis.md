# Domain Analysis
## Case description
In this two-player mode, Mario and Luigi compete for a number of big stars. Those stars will appear at random in the side-scrolling stages. The end of each of those stages is their beginning (the stages are looped). When Mario or Luigi are hit by enemies, fall down or hit each other, they lose a star, which can then be again collected by any of the brothers. The first brother to reach the previously set amount of stars wins the game. When a brother collects eight coins, a random power up will appear (Mushroom, Fire Flower, Blue Shell, Mini Mushroom, Mega Mushroom, Starman). When a brother has a certain amount of victories, he wins the match.
